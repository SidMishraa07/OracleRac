# Oracle Cluster Registry (OCR) – Introduction

## What is OCR?
- The **Oracle Cluster Registry (OCR)** is a central repository in Oracle RAC that stores:
  - Cluster configuration information
  - Node membership details
  - Database, ASM, and service information
  - Voting disk associations

It acts like the **“phonebook + diary”** of the cluster. Without it, the cluster does not know:
- Which nodes belong
- What databases and instances to start
- Which ASM disk groups to mount

---

## Key Characteristics
- Located on **shared storage** accessible by all RAC nodes.
- Protected by redundancy (normal/redundant copies).
- Managed by **Clusterware** processes.

---

## Raju’s Real-life Example
Imagine Raju runs a multi-office **delivery business**:
- OCR is like his **master Excel sheet** where he keeps:
  - All branch addresses (nodes)
  - Which branch manager is responsible (instances)
  - What vehicles are available (ASM disks)
  - Who delivers to which city (services)

If the file is lost → **the entire company becomes confused**.  
That’s why OCR is backed up automatically and redundantly.

# OCR Structure and Contents

## What OCR Stores
- Cluster node information
- ASM disk group data
- Cluster database names and instance names
- Services and their placement policies
- VIP configurations
- Application resource definitions
- Resource dependencies

---

## Internal Structure
- OCR is a **binary file**, not directly editable.
- Managed using:
  - `ocrdump` (read contents in text)
  - `ocrcheck` (check health)
  - `ocrconfig` (configuration and backups)

---

## Raju’s Scenario
Think of OCR like **Raju’s WhatsApp group** where:
- Group description = cluster details
- Group members = RAC nodes
- Admin roles = ASM + VIP resources
- Rules = services placement policies

If the group info is wrong, messages (resources) won’t go to the right people (nodes).

# OCR Backup and Restore

## Automatic Backups
- OCR automatically takes backups every **4 hours**.
- Keeps the last:
  - 3 weekly backups
  - 3 daily backups
  - Several hourly backups

Location:  
`$GRID_HOME/cdata/<cluster_name>/`

---

## Manual Backups
- Use command:
  ```bash
  ocrconfig -manualbackup
Raju’s Scenario

Imagine Raju’s delivery diary gets water spilled on it.
Luckily, he takes photocopies every 4 hours.
Even if today’s diary is ruined, he can pull out the last safe copy and continue running his business.
If he didn’t back up → customers won’t get their deliveries.

# OCR Mirroring and Redundancy

## Types of Storage
1. **Normal Redundancy (default)**  
   - Two OCR copies are maintained.
   - Stored in ASM or on different devices.

2. **High Redundancy**  
   - Three copies.
   - Provides maximum fault tolerance.

---

## Why Redundancy?
- Prevents single point of failure.
- If one OCR fails, the cluster reads from the other copy.

---

## Raju’s Scenario
Raju stores his **master Excel sheet** (OCR) in:
- **Google Drive** (copy 1)
- **USB drive** (copy 2)
- **External hard disk** (copy 3, if high redundancy)

If his laptop crashes, he can **still retrieve his file**.  
This way, his business **never stops**.

# OCR Check and Validation

## OCR Health Check
Command:
```bash
ocrcheck

## **06_OCR_Failure_Scenarios.md**
```markdown
# OCR Failure Scenarios

## Scenario 1 – Single OCR File Corruption
- Cluster continues working if mirrored copy exists.
- `ocrcheck` reports error.
- DBA must replace bad OCR with good copy.

---

## Scenario 2 – Both OCR Files Lost
- Clusterware cannot start.
- Only option: restore OCR from automatic/manual backup.

---

## Scenario 3 – Partial Corruption
- Some resources may fail to start.
- Example: Service configuration missing.
- Must restore OCR from backup.

---

## Scenario 4 – Wrong OCR Permissions
- Clusterware cannot write updates.
- Services may fail during relocation or startup.

---

## Raju’s Real-life Scenarios
- **Scenario 1**: One of Raju’s USB drives (OCR copy) gets corrupted. No issue, he uses the Google Drive copy.
- **Scenario 2**: Both USB and Google Drive are lost → He has to use last photocopy backup.
- **Scenario 3**: Excel sheet row for “Lucknow delivery van” disappears. Services stop in Lucknow only.
- **Scenario 4**: His assistant locks the Excel file → Raju cannot update it. Delivery assignments fail.
